# Guided Lab 330.2.1 – Correlation Coefficient & Covariance  
### Per Scholas – Data Analytics Program

---

## Overview

This repository contains my completed work for **Guided Lab 330.2.1**, where I explore the relationship between two variables — **Temperature (X)** and **Ice Cream Sales (Y)** — using the statistical concepts of:

- Covariance  
- Variance  
- Standard Deviation  
- Correlation Coefficient  
- Visual Analysis  

The goal of this lab is to understand *how* and *why* two variables move together, and to interpret the strength and direction of their relationship using both numerical calculations and graphical representations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, I was able to:

- Calculate the **means** of X and Y  
- Compute **deviations** from the mean  
- Calculate **covariance**, **variance**, and **standard deviation**  
- Compute the **correlation coefficient (r)**  
- Interpret whether the relationship is positive, negative, or neutral  
- Validate the relationship through **visualization**

## Dataset Used

| Day | Temperature (X) | Ice Cream Sales (Y) |
|-----|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1   | 20              | 100                 |
| 2   | 25              | 120                 |
| 3   | 15              | 80                  |

This dataset shows how ice cream sales may change depending on temperature.

## Summary of Results

- **Covariance:** +66.67  
- **Standard deviation (Temperature):** 4.08  
- **Standard deviation (Sales):** 16.33  
- **Correlation coefficient (r):** +1.0  

### Interpretation  
There is a **very strong positive linear relationship** between temperature and ice cream sales.  
As temperature increases, sales increase almost perfectly.  
Both the numerical results and the graph confirm this.

## Visual Interpretation

The scatter plot and trend line clearly show:

- A straight upward trend  
- Data points aligned closely along the line  
- A positive slope  
- Mean lines showing matching above/below-average movement  

This visually confirms the correlation coefficient of **approximately +1**.
